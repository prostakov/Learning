Standard solution:

public void Reverse()
{
    Node prev = null;
    Node curr = _head;
    Node next = null;

    while (curr != null)
    {
        next = curr.Next;
        curr.Next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }

    _head = prev;
}

More lean solution:


public void Reverse()
{
    Node previous = null;
    Node current = _head;
    while (current != null) 
        (previous, current, current.Next) = (current, current.Next, previous);
    _head = previous;
}
